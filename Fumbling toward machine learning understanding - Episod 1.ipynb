But the main issue, is that I fell sometimes I missed the basics of deep learning, as more and more libraries abstract many parts of models. So here is the first project. Let's Build a simple neural network with just numpy. Do not use know dataset, just try to modelize a sinus function. I will also have a very naive approach, start with a very simple neural network without bias and then try to correct it."
